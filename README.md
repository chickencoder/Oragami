# Origami CSS
A pure mobile-first responsive CSS3 library for creating modern web pages and interfaces without
unnecessary bulk.

Origami is still under **active development** meaning many primary features are yet to be implemented.

The framework is designed to be completely customizable through the source code but also tries its best not to get in the way of custom styling (like larger frameworks).
