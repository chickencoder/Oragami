# Origami
![Origami Logo](https://raw.github.com/chickencoder/origami/master/assets/logo.svg)
A pure mobile-first responsive CSS3 library for creating modern web pages and interfaces without
unnecessary bulk.

Origami is still under **active development** meaning many primary features are yet to be implemented.

The framework is designed to be completely customizable through the source code but also tries its best not to get in the way of custom styling (like larger frameworks).

## Overview
#### Ideology
The primary focus of origami is to provide a solid library for
creating aestheic and practical web pages. If it's not required, it's not there.

The framework (will eventually) include...
* A Folding Grid System
* A Responsive Typography Palette
* Beautiful Forms & Navigation
* Color Flavours (based on github.com/mmrs/colors)

Still to be implemented...
* A Responsive Typography Palette
* Beautiful Forms & Navigation
